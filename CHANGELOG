Changelog:

Version 0.8.0 (2017-12-13)
    - Added support for construct version 2.8.*

Version 0.7.2 (2013-02-05)
    - Initial beamformer system

Version 0.7.1 (2012-10-02)
    - Initial beamformer additions

Version 0.7.0 (2012-09-19)
    - fringe phase input now mod-360.

Version 0.6.9 ()
    - Updates to several snap scripts to improve compatibility with narrow band.
    - Bugfix to xstatus to reset terminal after clean exit
    - Bugfix to corr_snap_10gbe_tx.py which decoded frequencies incorrectly.
    - X-engine 10gbe cores were not being reset correctly in corr_functions.initialise and in the corr_init script (which should use corr_functions.init?).
      gbe_enable in the control register was being disabled, but isn't used in the gateware. The gateware uses the gbe_out_enable bit to stop transmission
      from the mux_out block.
      gbe_reset_hold_x/f and gbe_reset_release_x/f functions added to corr_functions to be used instead of using x/feng_ctrl_set_all directly.
    - corr_snap_descramble.py can analyse both descramble snap blocks on an x-engine board. Also plot the reassembled spectrum.
    - corr_snap_xaui_feng.py updated for new snapshot blocks.
    - corr_snap_xaui_feng_build_spectrum.py added. Rebuild and plot the spectrum from the snap_xaui block.
    - corr_nb and corr_wb for functions specific to narrowband/wideband modes.
    - Introduced corr_ddc placeholder.
    - register description/bitfields now separate
    - snapshots now unpacked by snap.py

Version 0.6.8 (2011-08-03):
    - Bugfix to n_accs calc with changes to acc_n_set/get

Version 0.6.7 (2011-07-20):
    - More reliable rx.py for interleaved RX mode. No more repeated accumulations.
    - Began adding functions for upcoming narrowband mode.
    - Started generalising bitfields

Version 0.6.6 (2011-04-04):
    - Added function to corr_functions to calibrate ADC spectrum.
    - Removed bits counter used from adc_amplitudes, which was an inaccurate reflection anyway.
    - Prettied time plots from snapshots, added spectrum etc. corr_adc_time now replaces corr_adc_histogram
    - RCS blocks now supported.
    - changes to fstatus, spead metadata, adc_amplitudes_get
    - added colour to log printouts when error occurs
    - changes to config file. system now basically single-pol. no more n_stokes, n_pol or pol map
    - support for arbitrary antenna names. parameters to all fuctions that used to take antenna,pol params now take single string param.
    - get_ant_location replaced by get_ant_str_location
    - single RX script... now calls threaded functions in rx.py.
    - added functions for per-engine status. useful for system health displays.
    - bugfixes to katadc's temp reading
    - katadc attenuator get/set implemented

Version 0.6.5 (2011-03-01):
    - Added software control for KATADC and iADC.

Version 0.6.4 (2011-02-09):
    - Bug fixes for systems using xaui loopback
    - added clear facilities to fstatus
    - removed stats library dependancy
    - bug fixes to scroller
    - bug fixes to snap capture in katcp_wrapper


Version 0.6.2 (2010-11-26):
    - Added example.conf file to distribution package.
    - Fix to corr_xstatus.py for case where F engines have 10GbE out and X engines have 10GbE (fabric) output.
    - Mod to corr_rx_cont_h5.py to allow for commanline disable of n_acc scaleback.
    - Mod to corr_arm to resync vaccs after rearm.

Version 0.6.1 (2010-11-25):
    - Fix to corr_snap_quant.py script.

Version 0.6.0
    - Support added for F engines that output data directly on 10GbE ports (ie no XAUI loopback through X engines).
    - Support added for X engines that process contiguous frequency chunks.
    - Should be backwards compatible with XAUI systems and X engines that process interleaved channels (corr-0.5.1).
    - Error handling mostly unified and coded to use logging everywhere rather than printing errors to the console.
    - Added funtion to check firmware versions.
    - Added SPEAD metadata.
    - Feng/Xeng ctrl registers now keep state across function calls and can automatically pulse, set or clear bits.
    - ADC and Requant histogram plotting improvements
    - Shift to curses display for ADC amplitudes and status reporting
    - Fix to fine delay calc in fr_delay_set call and added ability to disable load check.
    - New config file params to support above features. Some redundant and unnecessary params removed.

Version 0.5.1
    - Bugfixes relating to KATADC/iADC use.
    - Moving all scripts to function calls.
    - First PyPI submission.
    - Incomplete and untested. Development abandoned to start work on system with native Feng 10Gbe out.

Version 0.5.0
    - Requires reconfigurable (ie ROACH) F engines. Support for iBOB-based F engines has been dropped as we switch to KATCP-only connections.
    - significant changes to corr_functions and cn_conf to support ROACH based F engines.
    - Changed configuration parsing library to iniparse.

Version 0.4.2: 2010-04-02
     *) tgtap call in katcp_wrapper now takes another parameter to allow naming of tap devices. *NOT BACKWARDS COMPATIBLE*
     *) antenna numbering now correct off F engines.
     *) cn_tx.py replaced by corr_tx.py
     *) cleanup of some functions.

Version 0.4.0
    - KATCP control protocol.
